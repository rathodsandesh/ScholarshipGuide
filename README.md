# scholarshipguide
This is my college mini project which suggests the user optimum scholarship depending upon his inputs. The chatbot application asks the user to input various personal details and based on those details the application will fetch the details from MongoDB Atlas cluster and return it to the user. I have created the conversation in Dialogflow and created the cluster in mongodb atlas.
In server.js line 9 you have to enter your own admin id insted of [admin] and your mongodb atlas password instead of [password]
